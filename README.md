# Omnicalc Debug

## Target

Here is your target:

[https://omnicalc-debug.matchthetarget.com/](https://omnicalc-debug.matchthetarget.com/)

Click through your application and try to find the bugs in it; try to make your application match the target.

Use `rails grade` to confirm that you found them all.

## Standard Workflow

 1. Start the web server by running `bin/server`.
 1. Navigate to your live application preview.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing, but **make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target's behavior first**.
